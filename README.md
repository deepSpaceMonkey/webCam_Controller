# webCam-Controller

Snippet:

     This project was SOOOO COOl! Basicly you control the computer using your camera. You get an object with a unique color, in this case blue, 
     the program will locate it, put a box around it, and track it. If you move the object up, scroll up. If you move the object down, scroll down
